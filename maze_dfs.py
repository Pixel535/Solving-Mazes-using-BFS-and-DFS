# Function to find a route using the Depth-first Search algorithm.

# Depth-first search is an algorithm used to traverse a tree or generate nodes and paths in a tree. This algorithm
# starts at a specific node and explores paths of connected nodes of the first child and does this recursively until
# it reaches the furthest leaf node before backtracking and exploring other paths to leaf nodes via other child nodes
# that have been visited.

# Although the Depth-first search algorithm van be implemented with a recursive function. This implementation is
# achieved using a stack to better represent the order of operations as to which nodes get visited and processed.
# It is important to keep track of the visited points so that the same nodes do not get visited unnecessarily and
# create cyclic loops.
